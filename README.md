# DOM Capture

> Point at any element on a page, click it, and get that element — **with every style it and its descendants need** — on your clipboard as self-contained HTML.

Paste the result into an empty `.html` file and it renders the same, with no dependency on the original site's stylesheets, class names or JavaScript.

Works on plain pages and on pages built from **web components** — open *and* closed shadow roots, slots, `::slotted`, `:host`, `::part`, adopted stylesheets, nested components.

```
┌─ page ──────────────────┐            ┌─ clipboard ─────────────┐
│  ╔═══════════════════╗  │            │  <style> … </style>     │

```

## Install

1. Open `chrome://extensions` and switch on **Developer mode**.
2. **Load unpacked** → choose the `extension/` folder.
3. Pin the DOM Capture icon if you like.

Needs a Chromium-based browser, version 120 or newer.

**Permissions:** `activeTab` + `scripting` (it only ever touches the tab you invoke it on), `clipboardWrite`, and `storage` for your options. No host permissions, no background activity, nothing leaves your machine.

## Use

1. Click the toolbar icon, or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
2. Move the mouse — the element under the cursor is outlined and labelled with its tag and size.
3. **Click** to capture. The snippet is on your clipboard straight away.

| Key | |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Click</kbd> / <kbd>Enter</kbd> | capture the highlighted element |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> | widen to the parent (climbs out of slots and shadow roots too) |
| <kbd>↓</kbd> | narrow back down |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> / right-click | quit |

While you pick, an invisible overlay receives the mouse, so the page never sees your hover or click: links don't navigate, menus don't open, and the element is captured in its resting, un-hovered state.

After a capture you can **Copy again**, **Download .html** (a complete standalone page), **Preview** it in a new tab, or **Pick another**.

### Capturing dropdowns, popovers and dialogs

Anything that only exists once the page has been actuated: **open it first, then press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.** The shortcut leaves focus on the page so the menu stays open — clicking the toolbar button takes focus away, which closes many menus.

The overlay joins the browser's top layer, so it sits above `popover` elements and `<dialog>`s — including ones inside shadow roots, and ones that open *after* the picker started. Every mouse event is swallowed before the page's "click outside" handlers or the browser's popover light-dismiss can close what you are picking.

Menus held open purely by CSS `:hover` still close, because the page gets no hover.

## What you paste

```html
<!-- DOM Capture: <article> from https://example.com/pricing -->
<style>
@font-face { … }
@keyframes spin { … }
.dck3f9-1 { all: initial; display: block; padding: 20px; border-radius: 12px; … }
.dck3f9-1::before { content: ""; position: absolute; … }
.dck3f9-2 { all: unset; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px; }
.dck3f9-7:hover { background: rgb(55, 48, 163); transform: translateY(-1px); }
…
</style>
<article class="dck3f9 dck3f9-1" id="card"><header class="dck3f9-2">…</header>…</article>
```

- **None of the page's class names are reused.** Every `class` in the output is generated (`dc` + 4 random characters, checked to be unused on the page, so two captures never collide either). The original `class` attributes, inline `style`s, `on*` handlers and `<script>`s are dropped; the header comment names only the tag.
- Identical elements share one class, so lists and grids stay compact.
- Custom elements are renamed (`<user-card>` → `<user-card-snapshot>`) so a destination page that happens to define the same element can't re-upgrade and wipe the captured content.

## Options

Behind the **Options** button in the picker bar.

| Option | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hover & focus states | on | carry `:hover`, `:focus`, `:focus-visible`, `:focus-within`, `:active` rules |
| Page background | on | if the element is transparent, give it the background colour it was sitting on — white text from a dark page stays readable |
| Lock width | on | pin the root to the width it had on the page (it no longer has its column/flex parent to size it) |
| Web fonts | on | bring the `@font-face` rules for the weights and styles actually used |
| Embed all images & fonts | off | inline every asset as a `data:` URI — larger, but fully offline |

## How it works

`extension/src/capture.js` is the serializer; `extension/src/picker.js` is the UI.

**1. A predictable baseline.** Each captured element gets a class whose rule starts with `all: unset` (the root: `all: initial`). That cancels user-agent styles *and* whatever the destination page does to `p`, `button`, `h2`… so an element with no declaration is fully predictable: inherited properties take the parent's value, the rest take the CSS initial value.

**2. Typed OM instead of `getComputedStyle`.** `element.computedStyleMap()` returns *computed* values — `width: 50%`, `margin: 0 auto`, `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)`, `line-height: 1.5`, `translate(10%)` — where `getComputedStyle` would freeze them into pixels. The copy therefore stays fluid. Only properties that differ from the baseline are written (typically 5–15 per element rather than ~400), then folded into shorthands.

**3. Nothing hard-coded about CSS.** Initial values, which properties inherit, and which default to `currentcolor` are all measured at capture time in a scratch `about:blank` iframe, so new CSS properties work without an update.

**4. The flat tree.** The walker follows what is *rendered*: a shadow host's children are its shadow tree, a `<slot>`'s children are its assigned nodes (or its fallback content), unslotted light DOM is skipped. Closed shadow roots are reached through `chrome.dom.openOrClosedShadowRoot()`. Since computed styles already include the effect of `:host`, `::slotted()`, `::part()` and CSS variables crossing the boundary, the component renders the same with no JavaScript and no shadow DOM.

**5. Things computed style can't see** are recovered from the stylesheets of the document and of every shadow root involved — including `adoptedStyleSheets`, `@import`, `@media` / `@supports` / `@layer`, CSS nesting, and cross-origin sheets when the CDN sends CORS headers:

- `::before`, `::after`, `::marker`, `::placeholder`
- `:hover` / `:focus` / `:active` rules — including ancestor forms such as `.group:hover .child` and `a:hover::after` — re-targeted at the generated classes with `var()` resolved
- `@keyframes` — animated elements are read with their CSS animations momentarily detached, so the copy animates from the true base style rather than a mid-flight frame
- `@font-face`, picked with the CSS font-matching algorithm for the weights in use

**6. Things that would silently break on another origin are inlined automatically:** CSS `mask-image`s (cross-origin masks need CORS), web fonts whose server doesn't send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, SVG `<use href="sprite.svg#icon">` sprites (same-origin only), plus same-page `<symbol>`s, gradients and clip-paths referenced from outside the captured subtree.

**7. Live state is baked in:** input values, checked/selected state, `<canvas>` pixels (as an `<img>`), the `currentSrc` an `<img srcset>` actually chose. URLs are made absolute. `fill: currentColor` stays a keyword so icons follow hover colour changes.

Pages can't break the capture by naming elements after DOM properties (`<iframe name="styleSheets">`, a form control named `id` or `shadowRoot`…): those properties are read through the browser's native getters.

## When something goes wrong

If a capture fails, the panel shows the error and a **Copy debug log** button. The same button is on the success panel, for "it copied, but looks wrong" reports.

The log is plain text: extension version, page URL, browser, options, the picked element's ancestor trail and opening tag, a timed timeline of every capture step (stylesheets indexed per shadow root, elements walked, states matched, assets inlined…), warnings, and — on failure — the error, its stack, and the last step reached. It stays on your clipboard; nothing is sent anywhere.

## Known limits

- It is a **snapshot of the current viewport and state**: only `@media` rules that match right now are considered, `vw`/`rem`/`em` lengths arrive as pixels, and breakpoints don't travel. Percentages, `fr`, `auto`, flex and grid *do* stay fluid.
- Behaviour doesn't travel — no JavaScript, so dropdowns, tabs and carousels are captured as they looked.
- States that depend on a custom property changing (`.btn:hover { --bg: … }`), on `:host(:hover)`, on sibling combinators (`input:focus + label`), or nested inside `:not()` / `:is()` / `:has()` are skipped; so are `::selection`, scrollbar and `::first-letter` styles.
- Stylesheets on another origin *without* CORS headers can't be read, so hover rules, keyframes and fonts defined only there are missing — you get a warning naming the sheet. The element's resting appearance is unaffected.
- Sizing of `::before` / `::after` comes from `getComputedStyle` (pixels) unless a readable stylesheet shows it was `auto` or a percentage.
- Behind a **modal** `<dialog>` the browser makes everything else inert, the overlay included: picking still works, but the dialog's content does see your `:hover` while you pick.
- `<iframe>` content is not entered (the iframe is kept with an absolute `src`); `<video>` and `blob:` media keep their URLs.
- A locator screenshot is not a safe crop for a tall section when a fixed or sticky sibling (for example, a site header) can overlap it during Playwright scrolling. For pixel comparison in that case, capture the full source page and crop it from the recorded target geometry; inspect the crop for overlap rather than treating the locator image as isolated section pixels.
- Quirks-mode pages (no doctype) can differ by a few pixels once pasted into a standards-mode file.
- Privileged pages (`chrome://`, the extension gallery, the PDF viewer) can't be scripted at all — the icon shows a red `!` there.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # once; the e2e run needs a build that can load unpacked extensions
npm test
```

| Script | |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | capture suite + end-to-end suite |
| `npm run test:capture` | capture suite only |
| `npm run test:e2e` | end-to-end suite only |
| `npm run test:sites` | manual smoke test against live pages (see below) |
| `npm run icons` | re-render the PNG icons from `scripts/icon.svg` |
| `npm run zip` | package `extension/` for distribution |

**`test/run.mjs`** captures elements from the fixture pages in a real browser, renders the snippet in an empty `about:blank` page and **pixel-diffs** it against the original (currently 0.00% difference), hovers and focuses the copy to verify states, and asserts on the generated markup and CSS — for example, that none of the page's class names appear in the output. `test/fixtures/components.html` is the web-components torture test; `clobber.html` is a page whose named elements shadow DOM properties.

**`test/e2e.mjs`** loads the real extension, drives the picker with mouse and keyboard, and reads the result from the clipboard — this is what proves closed shadow roots work through `chrome.dom`. `test/fixtures/dropdowns.html` covers picking inside an open popover, a click-outside dropdown in a closed shadow root, and a modal dialog.

**`test/real-sites.mjs`** is a manual, network-dependent smoke test. Its targets aren't checked in: copy `test/real-sites.example.json` to `test/real-sites.json` and list your own pages as `["name", "url", "css selector"]`. Screenshots land in `test/output/real/`.

### Evidence bundles (no extension installation)

For a repeatable source-to-template evidence bundle, copy `evidence.config.example.json` and populate it only with origins you are authorized to inspect. The runner uses Playwright directly; it never loads the browser extension or sends data anywhere.

```sh
npm run evidence -- evidence.config.json evidence-output
```

Each capture emits a sanitized DOM Capture page (`.snapshot.html`), a redacted source screenshot (`.source.png`), and a `.json` record. The versioned `manifest.json` indexes the run. Records include requested/final safe URL and path, title, configured state, effective viewport/client width/DPR/font readiness, scroll/document height, root box, timing, warnings, local artifact paths and SHA-256s, and an asset URL inventory. Output is gitignored: snapshots and screenshots remain local evidence and are never added to this repository or uploaded anywhere. URLs must match an exact allowlisted origin, use credential-free HTTP(S), and may not redirect; blank titles, incomplete/failed fonts, and target `<img>` elements that fail or do not decode before capture are rejected. The receipt records image-ready totals plus sanitized failed/timed-out image URLs; it explicitly marks CSS background images as `not-verified`, because browser CSS backgrounds have no equivalent per-image decode signal. The gate waits up to 10 seconds by default; set a global or per-capture `imageReadyTimeoutMs` (1–30000) when a different bounded wait is appropriate. Selectors are captured at configured viewports, and optional bounds fail the record when the target is absent, invisible, or outside its allowed size. State is restricted to declared click, hover, and focus selector actions—configs cannot execute arbitrary page JavaScript.

Form fields identified as passwords or by common sensitive names (token, card, email, phone, and similar) are redacted from emitted HTML and masked in screenshots. Query-string values are redacted in all emitted output. This is deliberately a best-effort safeguard: do not target pages containing secrets in ordinary visible text, images, canvas, or remote assets; inspect bundles before sharing them.
